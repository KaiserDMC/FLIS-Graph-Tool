# Flight Inspection System (FLIS) Graph Tool
Converts FLIS' RAW datafiles (.txt/.csv) to better graphics.  
Some user input is needed in addition to the datafiles, thus MS Excel is utilised to fill the necessary information and import the data.  
All graphics are generated automatically using VBA Macros. Export to PDF files is also handled by a Macro script.  

## Variants
There are three variations of *Graph Tool* depending on which type of facility was inspected, i.e. what type of graphs can be generated: 
* ILS/LOC with or without DME
* C-VOR/D-VOR with or without DME
* E-DME
